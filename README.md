# Student Learning Analytics
## 📊 Project Overview
This is a comprehensive data analysis project based on the backend data of an educational app. Using multi-dimensional data such as student attendance rates and exam scores, we have built a user profiling system. . The goal is to gain a deep understanding of student learning behaviors, predict student learning behavior, provide early warning for student risk behaviors (such as skipping classes, not submitting assignments, missing exams, etc.), and offer data-driven decision support for optimizing educational products.

**Project Type**: University course assignment project  
**Data Source**: Anonymized backend data from a learning app (including attendance, grades, interactions, etc.)  
**Project Duration**: 4 weeks 
## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Student Profile Construction**: Create multi-dimensional labels for student behavior characteristics
- **Learning Performance Evaluation**: Develop a scientific scoring system for learning performance
- **Classroom Optimization Suggestions**: Propose targeted teaching improvement strategies based on data analysis
- **Product Feature Insights**: Provide data-based evidence for educational app feature updates

## 🔧 Technical Approach Overview
First, we organized the mapping relationships between the different data tables. Then,we used bi_kmeans clustering to classify students, obtaining data labels to facilitate better data analysis. we selected key metrics and scored student performance. We also conducted analysis on specific indicators to derive classroom planning suggestions.Plus, we employed regression algorithms to predict student risk indicators.
